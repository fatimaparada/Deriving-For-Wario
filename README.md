Problem: As usual, Wario is concerned about nothing other than acquiring more money. In order to maximize 
//             profits, Wario needs to use calculus to create derivatives for analysis.Unfortunately, Wario never took calculus; 
//             there wasnâ€™t much need of it in the Mushroom Kingdom.So, Wario is calling on you to help him by creating a 
//             program to create derivatives.
